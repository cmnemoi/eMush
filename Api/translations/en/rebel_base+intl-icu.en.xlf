        <target>We thank you for all the Mush information you have brought to the table. In exchange, we have sent you the plans to the Shkunz molecule. By administering a homeopathic dose to your rations, you should be able to increase your crew's productivity.//**Rations give an extra 1:pa:.**</target>

        <target>It was a pleasure to meet the heroes of the anti-Mush war. In our sector, the war for the control of the colonies is raging. We have sent you the plans for the PL80-Blaster, a powerful plasma cannon which should be handled with care, to facilitate your surface exploration expeditions. Fight until the end!//**Each Blaster gives 1 extra power point on expeditions.**</target>

        <target>Kaladaan here! We thank all members of the Daedalus for giving the hope of a promising future to the people of Sol. Since you left, the resistance has mobilized and we have already managed to infiltrate several Mush governmental agencies.

We must carry out our work with the utmost discretion which is why we have developed miniature comms systems implanted directly into our brains. Their plans have been forwarded to you.

        <target>We salute the crew of the Daedalus. 61 Cygni was explored during your voyage. The Federation is unaware that the majority of our information came from human sources. We are simulating the transmission of regular information using an adapted Pheromodem. By circumventing the Mush surveillance using this system we are preparing the rebel counterattack, plans for our SP2SP-230 missile have been transferred to NERON.//**Provides 3:pmo: for all crew members.**//**Patrol ships' damage is increased by one point.**</target>
