    3 {Fellow crew members, we have been charged with a mission the greatness of which is yet to be surpassed, and we have the means to succeed! The SDF knows this only too well, why else would they attack us?}
    4 {Comrades, have confidence! The Mush are trying to divide us and to demoralize us but their attempts shall be in vain if we remain united. I can feel that we will emerge victorious from this conflict. A bright future awaits us.}
    5 {Comrades! Our destiny is to save humanity... We are the hope that the martyrs of Sol have been waiting for and we will prove ourselves worthy of their legacy! We are the future and we shall advance until the end of time!}

    9 {I can see it in your eyes: the same dread that could engulf my heart. A day may come when the courage of humanity will fail, when all of us will succumb to infection. But that day has not yet come to pass. Today, we fight! I order you to stand proud, Humans of Sol!}
