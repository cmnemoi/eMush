        <target>As *Commander* you are the only person who can access this terminal.
////
Moving the ship is essential for **travelling to other planets** and could be useful for getting rid of hunters.
////
To go to a planet you need to **know the heading and the quantity of fuel required**. These two pieces of information can be obtained from the *Astro Terminal**. With this information, someone must first fill the combustion chamber with the appropriate amount of fuel. Then, set the Daedalus on the correct path and start the journey!
////
If the job has been done properly, the Daedalus will put itself into a planet's orbit, which can then be explored by the crew and new resources obtained!</target>

        <target>In order to find a planet to explore, you must firstly *run a scan* which will find a maximum of {max_planets} planets. The details of the planet scan are private and unique to every character.
////
Once a planet has been found and chosen, you should then communicate the *bearing and fuel requirement* for the journey to the crew. This allows the *Commander* to pilot the Daedalus towards the chosen planet.
////
When the Daedalus has arrived and is in orbit, it is impossible to scan to search for other planets. However, you can *scan the planet* you are orbiting to obtain additional GeoInfo. This information will be useful for the expedition team, who will be able to better prepare their exploration.
////
To leave orbit, the Commander in charge must give this order from the Command Terminal.</target>
