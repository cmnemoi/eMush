        <target>Sub-Lieutenant Andie Graham is still not aware that the Daedalus has cut all ties with the SDF. Still operating under the illusion that he/she is on a Federation-sanctioned mission, he/she is still working towards the mission objective. Upon discovering that their idol, Sgt Derek Hogan has joined the crew of the Daedalus, Andie applies for a position on board. Andie's unique skillset makes him/her invaluable in ensuring mission success.</target>

Following the Mush invasion of Sol, he drew up the plans for the Daedalus with Lai Kuan Ti, and assembled an elite crew to ensure the survival of the human race in another galaxy.</target>
