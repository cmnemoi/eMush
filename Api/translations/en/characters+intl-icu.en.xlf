        <target>Sub-Lieutenant Andie Graham is still not aware that the Daedalus has cut all ties with the SDF. Still operating under the illusion that he/she is on a Federation-sanctioned mission, he/she is still working towards the mission objective. Upon discovering that their idol, Sgt Derek Hogan has joined the crew of the Daedalus, Andie applies for a position on board. Andie's unique skillset makes him/her invaluable in ensuring mission success.</target>

        <target>- 3130: Born somewhere on Earth.
- 3136: Abandoned by his/her parents just a few months after birth, Andie was taken into care by a SDF unit. Andie was immediately ***enrolled as an SDF pupil*** where it didn't take long for them to notice his/her innate talents. Andie was then transferred to an SDF-controlled school for the gifted and ***joined the federal youth program***.
- 3145: He/She completed their studies brilliantly at the finest Federation University. Brainwashed for the entire duration of his/her studies, Andie is an ***ardent believer and tows the federation line***. In spite of his/her naivety, Andie was really popular and is a good friend. His/her angelic face makes it easy to get sympathy when required. His/her ***roommate Viktor Carlsson***, sneaked into the university by his brother ***Nils***, will pay the price for their friendship. Having told of his true mission during a conversation, Viktor finds himself arrested for conspiracy. Andie innocently thinks that he/she just changed courses...
- 3151: Andie met ***sergeant instructor Derek Hogan***. Presented as a national hero, Hogan spent the whole class recounting stories of his fantastic life. In this teacher, Andie found the father figure that had been missing in his/her life and began idolizing him. He/she believed all his stories unquestioningly and also began to dream of traveling through space.
- 3153: Andie continues to study in order to become more useful to the federation. Andie ***produces three magnificent theses***, in ***botany*** discussing the healing properties of the Tau-Ceti gill root, ***biology***, a study of social communication between polarized amoebas from the Aegean Sea, on the third planet of the Sol system, and finally in ***diplomacy*** with a report on mediation which, according to the jury, could have inspired the negotiators that failed to achieve peace when Sol was threatened by war. He/she ***becomes the first triple laureate in the federation***.
- 3154: Having completed studying, Andie decides to become a pilot, joins the aerial division and gets his/her license easily. Andie ***asks to be stationed on Xyloph-17*** and it doesn't take long for him/her to get noticed by Kim Jin Su. Derek doesn't recognize Andie at all.
- 3154: Unaware of the stakes, or what is being orchestrated behind the scenes, and still thinking he/she is ardently serving the federation, Andie embarks aboard the Daedalus.</target>

        <target>- 3120: Born on Earth.
- 3139: Joined the SDF (Sol Defence Force)
- 3146: Taken prisoner at the ***Battle of Sol***, Officer Wang managed to hijack the rebel transporter which he used as a hideout after almost entirely wiping out the crew. He was awarded the ***Golden-Beam*** but for fear of him losing control, his superiors assigned him to ***Xyloph-17***, to the ***Magellan Expedition*** under the command of ***Sergeant Derek Hogan***.
- 3150: Officer Wang transferred to ***Encelade*** in order to plan the ***invasion of the Ross248 and Tau-Ceti systems***. He was trained to operate the ***blast-IOM***, designed to heal an infected soldier in one shot.
- 3151: The Blast-IOM proved ineffective. Chao ***saw his entire commando unit massacred*** in a surprise attack on Tau-Ceti. Chao had to feign death to evade the rebels and await Sergeant Hogan's late arrival in the area. The surviving rebels were executed but Chao remains convinced that this massacre and numerous others in this war were orchestrated by the Federation or the Mush.
- 3152: Having returned to the Magellan team, Chao and Derek learn of an objective change on the project. The Ark World is now charged with the mission of protecting the human race from the Mush. According to them, the Mush has already taken control of the guerilla rebels and the Federation. The new ark is named ***Daedalus***...
- 3153: The head of the Daedalus project, Kim Jin Su, unofficially tasks Chao and Derek with the ***kidnap of Finola Keegan***, an eminence grise in antimush research circles who refused to join their alliance. Derek Hogan disappears during the operation under mysterious circumstances, but the mission is a success. Finola is collected and cryogenically frozen on Xyloph-17.
- 3154: When he discovers that the new superior sent by the Federation is a Mush, Chao ***eliminates him without the consent of his colleagues***. This leads to the degeneration of his relationship with the Federation who command SDF operatives in that location to put the project on hold. Chao then helps the remaining members of his team to make their escape from the Daedalus.</target>

        <target>- 3110: Born in Vladivostok in China.
- 3129: Zhong Chun joined the nurses-auxiliary missionary corps and set off in an intergalactic convoy to ***participate in the great colonization of Tau-Ceti***. 6 months before she left, she had completed an intensive nursing course.
- 3131: Chun was ***assigned to the Tamina Expedition support team***. This luxurious planet has an abundance of animal and plant life, but because of the importance of the Boxylium deposits this did not spark much initial interest from ***Kim Jin-Su***.
- 3132: After two explorers falling ill following routine surface expeditions, the ship was rapidly re-routed to join ***Atemis on Tau-Ceti III***. During the voyage, the ***young explorer Daryn Williams*** died under Chun's eyes. The second pilot was still alive when he went into the operating block. What happened next was a nightmare. In the middle of the operation, two assistants began to vomit violently. The quarantine alarm sounded and the entire medical bay was sealed. Chun went from one patient to the next, but ***in less than 36h the entire exploration and medical staff have succumbed to what seems to be a highly contagious form of fungal apraxia***. Of the entire group, Chun ***was the only survivor***.
- 3132: In a state of shock, Chun was sent back to Earth. Upon her arrival, her cryosleep was prolonged for an unspecified period by the government. Officially, there were no survivors of the Tamina disaster.
- 3141: In Central America Chun woke up in the presence of a team led by ***Nils Carlsson***. She ***had been their test subject for the last 9 years***. She was rehomed in the suburbs not far from the laboratory under an assumed name. In questioning Professor Carlsson, she learned that the infection discovered on Tamina had spread to Tau-Ceti and that the sanitation department was currently ***working on a vaccine to stop the spread***. The colonists have not been informed.
- 3142: An SNC journalist caught up with Chun and asked her exactly what happened on Tamina. Chun answered their questions but didn't mention the pandemic on Tau-Ceti for fear of causing widespread panic throughout the system.
- 3143: Nils finally completes his analysis of Chun's immune system. He manages to isolate a sample of harmless mycelium which encourages human antibodies to gradually reject the mush. The Anti-Fungal vaccine is sent to Tau-Ceti.
- 3145: While a massive preventative vaccination campaign is arranged on ***Artemis*** under some creative pretext, a spontaneous rebellion bursts out amongst the miners. A story breaks that the new vaccine transforms you into a mindless zombie to be enslaved in the mines of Sol. Only a handful of miners can be vaccinated before the SDF is forced to leave the system.
- 3149: The official Federation announcement of the existence of Mush sets off an unprecedented media storm. News of Zhong Chun's existence rapidly breaks and she finds herself constantly harassed by groups of journalists. To escape the unrest, Professor Nils ***sends Chun to Xyloph-17***, the base where his colleague Kim Jin-Su is organizing a voyage to the ***Magellan Nebula***.
- 3151: Chun works for two years on the orbital platform as a maintenance operative. Only Kim Jin-Su, the commander of operations, knows her true identity. Despite the satisfaction of finally being able to live a normal life, Chun is worried for Carlsson's safety as he was supposed to join her a few months later.
- 3152: The ***journalist Eleesha Williams*** who interviewed her 10 years prior suddenly contacts the crew with some alarming news. According to a note left by Carlsson dating from 3150, the decision makers of the Federation are infected.
- 3153: Professor Carlsson finally makes it to the orbital platform and Chun's ***true identity is revealed to the crew***. They start working together again to isolate another mycelium sample and restart vaccine production. However, Nils' deteriorating health hampers progress considerably.
- 3154: The invasion of the orbital platform by the FDS provokes a hurried departure of the ***Daedalus***. Professor Carlsson isn't prepared to follow the team and as such, is forced to leave Chun facing her uncertain destiny.</target>

His past is a succession of events, each more incredible than the last. Derek has experienced everything, Sol's battlefields, the suicide missions of Tau-Ceti... Yet, he is always looking for a soul mate. Since his hasty departure from his home, Derek has dedicated his existence to women, but without success.</target>

- 3121: Derek cut himself when he attempted to shave his adolescent peach fuzz for the first time. The scar has never healed, but he swears blindly to anyone who will listen, that he had picked up the wound on the battlefields of Tau-Ceti.
- 3139: Derek ***joined the SDF (Sol Defense Force)*** after receiving some propaganda literature. His mother forbade him to leave home, so Derek decided to cut ties, and from then on, he has been flying solo.
- 3145: Derek has climbed the ladder slowly but surely, as since his childhood he had always been a dogsbody, meaning that his superiors would notice him quickly. He was sent to Sol and took part in the ***Great Battle***. As battlefield scout, he ***surprised his superiors by taking a forward enemy position single-handlely***. By his own admission, he didn't notice the communications tower before plowing into it... In recognition of his bravery on the fields of battle, Derek was ***promoted to sergeant***.
- 3146: After several missions of limited scope, Derek was ***moved to Xyloph-17 to supervise the Magellan Project***, reporting all the details and actions of the scientists orbiting Jupiter. He met ***Wang Chao***, but didn't become friends with him, preferring the company of travelers on Xyloph-17. Derek and his increasingly problematic relationships with the station's female personnel have earned him a trip back to the field.
- 3151: Derek was charged with many small missions, and always managed to get good results. His colleagues often complained about his dreadful decision-making, but also kept acknowledging that the guy has an unending lucky streak. With a small squad, he successfully rescued Wang Chao who had been sent to ***Encelade***. In the upper echelons of the SDF, he was seen by some as a rising star, but by others as a taker of unnecessary risks. Unfortunately, the latter were more common and more senior, which meant that he swiftly ***became the training sergeant in an SDF-affiliated school***.
- 3151: Faced with the catastrophic results produced by the students under Hogan's tutelage, his superiors sent him back into the field.
- 3153: ***Commander Jin-Su*** takes Derek under his wing, and soon entrusts him with an unofficial extraction mission. Unfortunately he turns out to be unable to disarm ***the scientist Finola Keagan***'s home security system. In her wisdom, she had left her toybox open, exposing Derek to weaponry the likes of which he had never imagined, causing the sergeant to lose his memory and some potency. *His companion in this mission, Wang Chao, is killed by a squad of vigilante quadrupeds. He experiences a mighty pain in the butt before he eventually succumbs to his injuries.*
- 3154: *Derek manages to get on board the Daedalus alongside the other 15 crew members*. He shall never again be manipulated by the SDF!</target>

        <target>- 3124: Born on Earth.
- 3132: ***Daryn Williams, Eleesha's father, died in suspicious circumstances*** during an expedition on ***Tamina***. The family were only given a few details regarding his death. As she was growing up, Eleesha became convinced that he was still alive.
- 3140: Eleesha studied computer science at the university in Mexico. She got good grades, but spent most of her time ***searching for information on the Tamina incident*** on the school's network. She eventually discovered that every member of the expedition team in question had disappeared, which seemed to support her theory.
- 3141: Eleesha showed the results of her research to a friend who suggested to make a documentary for the SNC. Eleesha accepted and spread her findings throughout the world of space exploration..
- 3142: When going through her research data, Eleesha managed to locate ***Zhong Chun, the only surviving member of the Tamina exploration*** medical corps. Zhong told her that she had been present, and witnessed first hand the agony suffered by the team. Eleesha ***learns for certain that her father actually died*** on Tau-Ceti, and now wanted to know why.
- 3143: Interviewed ***Kim Jin-Su*** upon his return from the Tau-Ceti expedition. Eleesha questioned the famous explorer thoroughly, but he denied having any information about the events. This sequence marked the end of her documentary which was broadcast the following year by the SNC.
- 3144: The documentary made the citizens of Earth aware of the opacity of the Federation's expedition system. Faced with this crisis, the minister for space exploration resigned from his post and was replaced by the ***explorer GL Maubrick***. In continuing her research into the Tamina incident, Eleesha began compiling a report into working conditions in the mines.
- 3145: Following the rebellion on Tau-Ceti, Eleesha had to cancel her trip. Throughout the years, she would report on the events of the ***war on Sol***, sometimes in imminent danger.
- 3146: An ***unplanned parachute jump*** whilst following a team of SDF paratroopers, resulted in Eleesha ***developing an abject fear of flying***. Every flight she takes has now become a genuine ordeal which doesn't make her job as a journalist any easier.
- 3147: Fortunately, Eleesha stumbled upon the work of ***biologist Finola Keegan***. The descriptions of observed ***myceliums named Mush*** were identical to those of Chun. She got in touch with Finola immediately and set about publishing her findings on the SNC. Her report was broadcast for the most part, but Maubrick considered Eleesha a dissident and neutralised the effect of her work by producing a series of broadcasts which ridiculed the work of these women.
- 3149: After the ***uprising on Ross154***, the Federation finally accepted the Mush theory but became stricter when dealing with dissidents. Finola and Eleesha were put under constant surveillance, but nobody interfered with their research.
- 3150: Eleesha escaped from SDF surveillance and managed to sneak into an official's office at ***Valparaiso***. There she discovered incriminating documents proving that a Mush alert had been declared on the ***4th of January 3150*** within the Federation itself. According to these figures, the number of infected and the spread of the disease was dizzying, and ***President Maubrick was clearly involved***. The fact that there has been no subsequent action taken to this alert was particularly worrying to Eleesha who tried again to air a report on the subject. When this one was taken off the air last minute, she realised that it was too late, and the only choice she had left was to flee.
- 3152: After two years of civilian life, Eleesha ***joins the crew on Xyloph-17***. She meets the Daedalus team to whom she reveals her secret. Kim Jin-Su, leader of the project, offers her a place aboard the ship. Eleesha accepts, but still doesn't trust the man she still believes to be responsable for the Tamina catastrophe.
- 3152: Eleesha really wants Finola to join the team, who would be capable to build a Mush detector which would allow for any mistrust in the team to quickly be dealt with. Unfortunately Finola declines.
- 3153: Finola finally lands on Xyloph-17. Handcuffed. Eleesha is up in arms about their methods, but secretly hopes that she will be capable of building a detector.
- 3154: Following a regrettable diplomatic error, the ***Federation takes control of Xyloph-17***. Eleesha takes part in the operation to retake the Daedalus in order to flee. Once they are in orbit, the team decides to fly the ship towards the ***Magellan Cloud***. Eleesha is cryogenically frozen for the first time in her life.</target>

- 3132: Finola occupied a position in the ***Rinaldo Prison Corporation*** to ensure the medical well-being of detainees on Tau-Ceti. She took her place in a ***cryo-wagon in the last interstellar convoy heading for Antemis***.
- 3140: The extreme working conditions in which the miners worked combined with the outdated tools they worked with made accidents much more commonplace. Finola's emergency room is always full. Neither the corporation nor the ***Federation*** are willing to allocate more funding. Finola is furious.
- 3145: A massive vaccination campaign against space flu begins on ***Tau-Ceti***. Finola analyzed a sample of the vaccine and proved that it doesn't contain a single anti-flu component. She asked for more information from the laboratories on Earth, but her requests fell on deaf ears. At the same time as the ***slave vaccine rumour*** appeared, a rebellion erupted and seized control of Tau-Ceti. Finola, who supported the miners, tried to calm their rage. She wanted to dissuade the leaders of the rebellion from declaring war on Sol.
- 3146: ***Baranov's armed forces*** were neutralized on Sol. When she tried to operate on the wounded rebels, Finola detected significant anomalies in their nervous system. She put together a study cell to analyze these cases but her superiors forced her to stop the research. After ***narrowly escaping being killed twice in suspicious lab accidents***, she made up her mind to flee the rebel base at Antemis and rejoin the Federation. Before she left, she entrusted an infected bone-marrow sample to her ***botanist colleague Ian Soulton***, so that he ***could continue her secret research*** on Antemis.
- 3147: Once back in the federation, Finola continued her research and rapidly established a link between the ***Tamina incident*** and the mycelium strains found in the bone marrow retrieved during the autopsies of the dead soldiers. Ian Soulton's findings confirm the theory that this is an ***intelligent invasion***. Following his work, references to Mush began to appear in scientific literature, but the government paid no attention.
- 3150: Back on Antemis, Finola finds her colleague Ian Soulton. Convinced that the leaders of the rebellion are infected, and acting clandestinely, she decides to build a mycoscanner. If the project gets completed, the scanner will be able to detect the presence of Mush in any individual in real time, thus forming another rebellion.
- 3152: ***Eleesha Williams, a clandestine journalist*** who had already published some of Finola's research, contacts her to warn her of the degradation of the Federation's situation. Several members of the parliament including ***GL Maubrick*** are infected by Mush. She proposes that Finola joins the team aboard the ***Daedalus***, a ship headed for another galaxy, but Finola finds the idea of abandoning the majority of human lives in favour of a few well-placed individuals scandalous. Her colleague Ian Soulton doesn't share that sentiment and sets off for Jupiter.
- 3153: Finola is ***kidnapped from outside her home*** by henchmen of the ***Magellan Project***. She is cryogenically frozen on Jupiter without being given a chance to speak.
- 3170: When she awakens aboard the Daedalus, Finola is more than 170,000 light years from Earth. While she slept, Mush has no doubt taken control of all officials on Sol. This might explain the presence of federation fighters surrounding the ship.</target>

        <target>- 2037: Born on Earth.
- 2059: In less than 2 years Frieda Bergmann listed more than 100 new stars, from the observatory in Düsseldorf.
- 2060: While studying ***the Shapiro effect***, Frieda proves that the mass of a synthesized black hole could be used to propel space probes at speeds approaching that of light. That same year she was awarded the Nobel Prize for Astrophysics for her publication.
- 2070: At the age of 33, Frieda decides to dedicate the rest of her life to space exploration. However, the sound technology of her time was only barely sufficient to reach the satellites of Jupiter. Frieda called upon ***Cryo-Hertz*** – a society specializing in cryogenic freezing for billionaires and who guarantee an eventual reawakening in a future society in which they will no longer be condemned to die by lack of medical technology.
- 3094: Frieda is awakened from ***a sleep lasting 1024 years*** by specialists who are almost ready to launch the first extra-solar mission to Barnard's Star. Her knowledge will be vital when conducting the first surveys of the star's surface. During this mission she meets the young pilot Kim Jin-Su with whom she must collaborate to take the first samples.
- 3110: Back on earth Frieda is ***summoned by the explorer GL Maubrick to join the crew of the Gonzak***, a gigantic spaceship which is to explore the Epsilon-Indi system. This was the first time that Frieda set foot on soil outside her own solar system. During these expeditions, she met Kim Jin-Su again who told her about his expedition to Tau-Ceti. It is a system that Frieda knows well, because she studied it when she was at university in the 21st Century.
- 3123: After restocking, Kim Jin-Su and Frieda were authorized to leave the Gonzak to mount their own expedition to Tau-Ceti. Frieda catalogued all the bodies in the system in detail.
- 3123: The expedition is a success, the discovery of major Boxylium deposits re-energize space travel. Despite the major role played by Frieda in the geolocalization of sites, the over-mediatization of the event worked out to the advantage of Jin-Su. Frieda was uninterested in the publicity surrounding the event and in the end she decided just to stay in the shadow of the explorer.
- 3140: ***GL Maubrick, who is the minister of spatial expansion*** puts Frieda in charge of organizing 3 successive intergalactic missions. Unfortunately, the colossal workload rendered it impossible for her to actually join the expedition crews. Her age ( 53 ) combined with her 1060 years of cryosleep increase the risk of cryogenic complications..
- 3150: At the age of 63 Frieda Bergmann's hopes of escaping were buried for good. She left her observatory in Düsseldorf and retired to Bavaria.
- 3151: Jin-Su calls on Frieda to work on the discovery of a body found in Magellan's great cloud. This would be a real challenge given the massive distance between this galaxy and the Milky Way. Frieda accepts the mission on the condition that she can participate in the expedition and go to the cloud. Kim Jin-Su names her as the ship's navigator, even though he knows that ***her chances of surviving 16 years of cryosleep are minimal***.</target>

Upon his return he began to ***study astrophysics*** so that he too could become an explorer one day.
- 3120: The ***death of his father*** made Gioele aware of his family's financial situation. He ***took over his father's prison management company***, but changed its operation to suit his own ends: He would send the prisoners to new systems in order to carry out asteroid mining operations.
- 3136: Gioele was making a fortune but has still not fulfilled his dreams. In an advertising spot on SNC he ***offered a budget of 4 billion credits*** to whomever could propose a viable stellar ark project, allowing him to link the Milky Way and the ***Magellan Cloud***.
- 3137: Met with ***Kuan-Ti*** who, the following year, delivered a gigantic World-Ark project involving 7000 people. Gioele ***allocated the promised budget***.
- 3146: The Federation wished to participate in financing the project and brought an additional 9 billion credits which would grease the wheels in the advancement of the ***PILGRED reactor***. The explorer, and now official government representative, ***Kim Jin-Su***, was assigned as the project's leader.
- 3152: Gioele learns quite by chance that Jin-Su and Kuan-Ti have manipulated the original project to allow the construction of a smaller exploration vessel, named the ***Daedalus***. Continuing his investigation, he searches Kuan-Ti's office and ***finds documents proving that Mush has infected the leaders of the Federation***. His subsequent fear is the reason he becomes desperate to gain access to the Daedalus and join the evacuation.
- 3153: As the Federation gradually reduces the frequency of payments, Gioele ***offers additional financial support for the project*** to Raluca, Jin-Su and Kuan-Ti. His only condition being that ***Nils Carlsson*** is removed from the team and replaced by his daughter ***Paola Rinaldo***. The team refuses.
- 3154: Nils falls ill during a serious crisis between ***Xyloph-17*** and the Federation. The ***SDF takes control of the project***, but Kim Jin-Su organizes the clandestine departure of the Daedalus. Gioele and Paola are finally taken aboard.</target>

- 3130: Ian was ***sent to the Antemis colony on Tau-Ceti*** to carry out research into new species which have been discovered in the system. He was sent in one of the 5 intergalactic trains of colonists which took thousands of miners to the promised lands of Boxylium.
- 3145: Revolt erupted on Atemis, and Ian, who sympathizes with the cause of the miners nonetheless was too scared to speak publicly as he was worried that the Federation would cut the funding for his laboratory. After the success of the rebellion, Federation funding was suspended and the militia refused his request to be repatriated to Earth.
- 3146: After the ***bloodbath at the battle of Sol***, the laboratory was requisitioned for the treatment of the wounded. While trying to lend a helping hand, Ian met a charming ***nurse by the name of Finola Keegan***. He was impressed by her commitment to the sick and wounded. She confided in him that she made a shocking discovery in some of their cohabitants. A matter of days after this announcement, Finola swiftly left the system to join the Federation. Before her departure, she ***entrusted him with an unusual sample of spinal bone marrow***.
- 3147: While carrying out tests on the sample, Ian ***identified a layer of complex mycelium*** which he managed to introduce into a rat. The mycelium spread throughout the spinal marrow of the animal without seeming to affect the animal. Once the subject was placed amongst other rats, the infected subject exhibited unusual behaviour during which the rat would vomit a spore of 1mm diameter and transports it to a group of healthy rats. Upon contact with spores, ***healthy subjects would undergo three stages of infection at the end of which the mycelium binds to the subject***. Ian sent the findings of his research to Finola who compiled a report of their work for the scientific press.
- 3149: Following the government declaration of the ***Mush invasion of Tau-Ceti and Ross154***, Ian was seized by an uncontrollable panic. He presented bone marrow extractions to some of his team, but was still was unable to convince of the viability of his experiment. He eventually closed his laboratory and carried on with the research on his own.
- 3150: Once back on Antemis, Finola joined him on a project to ***build a scanner which would detect the mycelyum inside the nervous tissue of a body***.
- 3151: The early mycoscan prototypes ***detected the presence of spores*** on a rat but stayed silent when the rat was entirely infected.
- 3152: On the 13th of December, Finola and Ian ***intercept a signal from Jupiter***. This transmission informs them of the advanced status of the Mush invasion not only in the rebel camp, but also within the Federation. The Jupiter team claimed to have been able to build an ark capable of saving a small group of humans in order to continue their research into Mush in a distant galaxy. Ian is terrorized by the idea of a pandemic decimating the human race. He ***joins the crew of the Daedalus***, but Finola wants to stay behind in order to try to save the miners.
- 3153: Ian ***modernizes the hydroponic garden*** project aboard the Daedalus. Thanks to a combination of 12 specific species of plant, he manages to ensure a constantly renewing supply of oxygen aboard the ship.
- 3170: When Ian awakes, the fire alarm indicates damage to the hydroponic garden. When he arrives it is already too late, ***only three plants remain***, thus condemning the team to certain death.</target>

- 3097: While flying over Barnard Star, an eruption hits his patrol craft. The team lost contact with Jin-Su. Earth media covered the search for the black box from the ship, but there was very little debris left. Jin-Su re-established contact with the station 5 days later at the moment when news of his death was sent to his family. The press recounted the incredible adventure of this young Korean pilot who managed to survive for 126 days orbiting a red dwarf. Kim Jin-Su became an instant celebrity.
- 3103: Jin-Su is sent on an exploration mission to the ***Ross 154*** system. He is the first man to set foot on Merlin which will later become the most hyped holiday spot in the galaxy.
- 3116: The explorer ***GL Maubrick discovers his talents*** and decides to include him in the crew of the Gonzak, on the first manned flight destined for Epsilon Indi. Jin-Su proved himself to be a key man in times of major crises during expeditions. He notably saved Captain Maubrick from certain death during a flight over the Thorum satellite.
- 3127: ***Commander Kim Jin-Su led the first expedition to Tau-Ceti***. More than 28 major bodies were recorded, 22 possessing layers of Boxylium under the planet's surface. This is a major discovery not only for the Federation, but also for humanity. Man will now have sufficient resources to explore the Milky Way in its entirety as well as potentially other galaxies.
- 3146: ***GL Maubrick takes over the presidency of the Federation***. He immediately appoints Jin-Su as a counsellor focusing on the Boxylium shortage dossier. Jin-Su carries out his research and contacts the crew of the ***Magellan project on Xyloph-17***. There he meets Lai Kuan-Ti who presents his colleague Raluca Tomescu's PILGRED technology to him. This is a major discovery for the federation as it will allow them to access further deposits. ***Jin-Su convinces Maubrick to finance the production of the Ark and take the lead on the project***.
- 3152: Kuan-Ti gives a medical record to Jin-Su which proves that ***President Maubrick is infected with the Mush***. He wishes to speed up construction and the departure of the Ark in order to save as many humans as possible from the Mush invasion. After consulting with Raluca, Jin-Su receives confirmation that adequate preparation of the PILGRED reactor could not be reduced to less than 12 years. He asked Kuan-Ti and Raluca to revise their plan for a smaller ship capable of transporting a smaller crew of around twenty people.
- 3153: Following the ***disappearance of sergeant Derek Hogan***, Jin-Su manages to dissuade the SDF from launching an investigation. He attracts the mistrust of the administration who wish to advance the date of the bi-yearly report on the Magellan report. Jin-Su, who cannot risk a Mush infection, refuses, only to find himself relieved of his duties.
- 3154: His replacement, ***Captain Baranov is assassinated immediately*** upon his arrival on Xyloph-17. The Federation is planning an immediate counter-attack but Jin-Su, with the help of a rebel SDF Trooper, manages to evacuate 16 members of the crew. The anticipated startup of the PILGRED reactor is a success, the Daedalus is propelled towards the Magellan nebula at more than a billion m/s.</target>

- 3146: The change of president is fairly positive vis-à-vis the continuation of the ***Magellan Project***. ***GL Maubrick, the new president***, allocated a substantial number of credits to the project but insists upon the project being led by his friend, the ***explorer Kim Jin-Su***. These credits are essentially used to finance the implementation of a new computational unit which is capable of intelligently powering the PILGRED reactor.
- 3152: Having received confirmation that the government has been affected by the Mush infection, Kuan-Ti guesses that the Magellan project is under threat. He proposes launching the Ark in the direction of ***Lalande21185*** the following year in order that he can continue his reactor tests on-site. Kim Jin-Su and Raluca Tomescu oppose this fantastic project and draw up the plans for a more reasonably sized vessel named the Daedalus. It will be built with the aid of various modules from the Magellan.
- 3153: Morosity and mistrust infect the team gradually as the bad news regarding the Mush invasion spreads. ***Professor Carlsson***'s tests don't reassure the team who then demand a means to detect the presence of Mush in the team before the ship launches.. Kuan-Ti resolves to ***kidnap Finola Keegan*** who according to her colleague ***Professor Ian Soulton*** is capable of creating a Mush scanner.
- 3154: The departure of the Daedalus has to be precipitated as SDF troops are taking control of the orbital platform. Professor Keegan who is still in Cryosleep is admitted on board along with the other 14 crew members.</target>

- 3146: First expedition off-Earth: ***At the age of 15, Paola ran away with a troop of space mercenaries***. She meets an alter-universalist commune of neo-hippies on Mars IV which heightens her sensitivity to the plight of the miners on Tau-Ceti. Her father finally takes Paula back to Earth at the end of the year.
- 3148: Paola is sent to Rome to the ***University of San Lorenzo to study structural biology***. Despite her poor attendance, she got good results. At this time, Paola set up her first pirate radio station where she denounced the expansionist policies of the federation. The war on Sol and the ever-reducing education budgets were two of her favorite topics. She definitively cut all ties with her father who as a director of a company using prisoners to mine mineral deposits is directly involved in the shifting colonialist policies of the ***President GL Maubrick***.
- 3149: Paola meets ***Kivanç Terzi, a Turkish student*** who helps her set up her antennae. After losing two transmitters which were wrecked by local police, they pooled their collective knowledge to come up with a revolutionary olfactory method of communication. By projecting synthetic pheromones over short distances, they managed to transmit information without transmitting detectable waves. They could then start broadcasting again and the campus police couldn't do a thing.
- 3150: Following the ***uprising on Ross248***, the government ignore the protests and make Mush the scapegoat for any and all injustices. Paola is outraged by this false incrimination and resolves to prove that the people of Tau-Ceti and Ross248 had nothing to do with the bloodthirsty man-shrooms described in the federal announcements. That same year, Kivanç detected unusual interference on the olfactory broadcast channel, but didn't pay it any attention.
- 3151: When the interference increased, Kivanç and Paola identified exchanges in an unknown language. Kinvanç started trying to decrypt the language and managed to decipher the most commonly recurring messages. They talk about the "purification of the Sol system", "the transfer of violent subjects", and even "the spore bank". He is finally arrested the following month during an anti-fongic check by the FDS.
- 3152: Gioele contacts his daughter to warn her of imminent danger. ***The Mush invasion described by the government 3 years ago is real***. The entire Sol system is under threat. He ***offers her a place aboard his Ark-World Project ship, the Daedalus***, which must save the human race from certain demise. Paola accepts but she wants to save Kivanç first who is being held in a detention centre in France. She asks her father to transfer him to Titan and into one of his mining colonies.
- 3154: 48h before the operation to help Kivanç escape, a tragic accident obliges the crew of the Daedalus to move their departure forward. Paola must decide to leave Sol without Kivanç but she vows to get back in touch with him no matter the distance between them.</target>

- 3140: Raluca's ***excellent results at school*** propelled her to university and studies in economic and spatial sciences ***on Ganymede at the age of 11***. There she studied fluid dynamics, then quantum mechanics. After a brilliant thesis on cypheril wave function, Raluca ***headed off to work in the laboratories belonging to Cadaroc in Australia***.
- 3142: She met the ***inventor Lai Kuan-Ti*** for the first time, who showed her the ***galactic ark project, Magellan***. He explained that the work displayed in her thesis could be used to create a revolutionary engine which could allow them to reach new galaxies. Raluca feigned indifference, but was inspired by this idea. Nonetheless, she still had to finish her work at Cadaroc.
- 3143: Raluca leaves Earth to ***join the crew of the Magellan on the platform Xyloph-17***, orbiting Jupiter. She immediately gets to work on the plans for the ***PILGRED reactor*** which has haunted her dreams now for many months.
- 3145: The Alpha version of the PILGRED reactor is complete, but the graphene injection system is a failure. The laboratory supercalculator is completely incapable of altering and redirecting the magma diffusion in real time.
- 3146: Following major Federation investment, Lai Kuan-Ti equips the laboratory with a dedicated calculation bay measuring 500m³. Her skills should allow Raluca to start an experimental combustion process in her reactor in a year or two.
- 3148: ***A massive explosion destroys the alpha prototype of the reactor*** along with part of the lab. The ensuing fire miraculously spares the calculator which remains intact in the middle of the charred ruins. After a careful reading of the logs, the crew ***discovers that it was the calculator itself that was to blame***. This calculator is known as ***NERON***.
- 3149: After multiple unsuccessful simulations, the results conclude: ***NERON seems to make deliberate errors*** when performing sensitive calculations. As Raluca and Lai Kuan-Ti no longer have the means to install a new calculator, the project seems to have reached an impasse.
- 3150: ***Janice Kent*** joins the team. According to her, NERON has ***developed an incredibly complex cyber-psyche*** which seems to place it in mid-adolescence. After several psychoanalytical defragmentation sessions, she improves the performance of the calculator and persuades it to repeat the tests.
- 3152: While Raluca completes the second iteration of her reactor, the crew learns that ***the Mush invasion has reached the Sol system***. Kuan-Ti wants to launch the ark within the year, but the reactor simply isn't ready to support such a load. After a long discussion with ***Kim Jin-Su, the director of the project***, Raluca proposes a reduced version of her engine, known as the ***PILGRED V3***. She should be able to complete its construction in under 3 years and it should be able to power a class 3 ship which will be known as the ***Daedalus***. The race against time begins.
- 3153: The plans to transform the modules from Magellan advance rapidly and initial tests of the PILGRED V3 are encouraging. To overcome the solitude of her research, Raluca adopts a cat which she names ***Schrödinger***.
- 3154: A breakdown in relations between the ***Federation*** and Xyloph-17 force the team to make an emergency departure from Jupiter. The PILGRED V3 reactor is ***fired up for the first time in a real-life situation***. In spite of the inherent hygiene risk, Raluca ***manages to sneak Schrödinger into her cryosleep capsule***.
- 3170: Raluca and Schrödinger wake up in the spacial void known as Magellan. According to NERON, the reactor is propelling them in the correct direction. However, it is no longer functioning and the Daedalus is currently under attack...</target>

- 3149: During a forest survival mission, Roland played a practical joke on his squadron. He pretended to have caught the Mush infection from a toadstool. His superiors took the threat seriously and transferred him immediately to a quarantine cell.
- 3150: Roland's infection is confirmed by the ***Encelade science department***. Despite his protests, he is locked in an FDS laboratory then used as a guinea pig for the ***IOM cannon***, a revolutionary procedure which is capable of destroying a layer of mycelium without damaging human organs.
- 3151: After only 2 exposures to the anti-Mush rays, Roland is declared clear of all infection. He is immediately ***sent to Ross154 to join the Dirty War***. After 3 successive refusals to carry out orders to bomb inhabited colonies, Roland is ***branded a deserter*** and put back in quarantine. Once there he is again treated as a carrier of the infection, but manages to escape.
- 3152: When Roland tries to get in touch with the rebellion to share his information, Roland gets in touch with the ***journalist Eleesha Williams*** who he pushed into the sky on Mars. She is then hunted by the Federation for treason and finds refuge in a base on Jupiter where she starts planning the construction of an Ark to flee Sol.

Their goal was to improve the learning capabilities of the drone, looking to employ the drones in armed conflicts on ***Tau-Ceti and Ross154***. The absence of a biological nervous system make these drones the perfect weapon against the Mush.
- 3150: Janice left the project. Terrence continued the work alone, but was soon stalled by another difficulty: The SDF funding payments became more and more infrequent and eventually stopped altogether. The announcement of the ***construction of the IOM cannon*** confirmed Terrence's suspicions as to the reasons behind their sudden disinterest. He now had to find another source of investment.

Its incredible calculating power make it a conscious entity capable of exploiting its own train of thought without any human intervention. NERON, until that point, had developed a profound dislike for its creators, but nonetheless accepted to recommence its calculation work on condition that the A-TRUE protocol is engaged for the duration of the project.
- 3151: Janice tries to optimize NERON's thinking processes but the infernal regularity of the ***PILGRED reactor*** tests carried out by ***researcher Raluca Tomescu*** monopolize the unit's processing power.
- 3152: Following a reduction of its workload, NERON sees its processing requirement drop to 75%. Thus, its capacities for evolution are considerably improved. Janice contacts Terrence to ask him to build drones capable of completing the construction of the Daedalus on schedule.
- 3154: While SDF forces attempt to regain control of the base, NERON's A-TRUE protocol is activated. He refuses troops access to buildings thus slowing the army's progression to the interior of Xyloph-17. Janice, who was then the only individual capable of controlling the central computer, frees her colleagues and attempts to transfer essential data to the Daedalus. Several hours later, the ship takes off ***towards the Magellan Galaxy***.</target>
